# Development

## <a name="testing"></a>Testing
To run tests locally follow these instructions

### Build the Project and Run Unit Tests
You will need Java development environment (JDK, Maven), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) 
to build the project. You can also use dockerfile in (./.cirrus/nodejs-lts.Dockerfile) which bundles all dependencies and 
is used for CI pipeline.

To build the plugin and run its unit tests, execute this command from the project's root directory:
```
mvn clean install
```

### Integration Tests
To run integration tests, you will need to create a properties file like the one shown below, and set its location in an environment variable named `ORCHESTRATOR_CONFIG_URL`.
```
# version of SonarQube server
sonar.runtimeVersion=6.5

orchestrator.updateCenterUrl=http://update.sonarsource.org/update-center-dev.properties
```
Before running any of integration tests make sure the submodules are checked out:
```
 git submodule init
 git submodule update
```
#### Plugin Test
The "Plugin Test" is an additional integration test which verifies plugin features such as metric calculation, coverage etc. To launch it, execute this command from directory `its/plugin`:
```
mvn clean install
```  

#### Ruling Test
The "Ruling Test" is a special integration test which launches the analysis of a large code base, saves the issues created by the plugin in report files, and then compares those results to the set of expected issues (stored as JSON files). To launch ruling test:
```
cd its/ruling
mvn clean install
```

This test gives you the opportunity to examine the issues created by each rule and make sure they're what you expect. You can inspect new/lost issues checking web-pages mentioned in the logs at the end of analysis:
```
INFO  - HTML Issues Report generated: /path/to/project/sonar-javascript/its/sources/src/.sonar/issues-report/issues-report.html
INFO  - Light HTML Issues Report generated: /path/to/project/sonar-javascript/its/sources/src/.sonar/issues-report/issues-report-light.html
```
If everything looks good to you, you can copy the file with the actual issues located at
```
sonar-javascript/its/ruling/target/actual/
``` 
into the directory with the expected issues
```
sonar-javascript/its/ruling/src/test/resources/expected/
```
