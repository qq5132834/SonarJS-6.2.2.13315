<p>A function that grows too large tends to aggregate too many responsibilities.</p>
<p>Such functions inevitably become harder to understand and therefore harder to maintain. </p>
<p>Above a specific threshold, it is strongly advised to refactor into smaller functions which focus on well-defined tasks.</p>
<p>Those smaller functions will not only be easier to understand, but also probably easier to test.</p>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>This function ignores Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE), which are functions that are created and invoked without ever being assigned
a name.</p>

(function () { // Ignored by this rule

    // ...
