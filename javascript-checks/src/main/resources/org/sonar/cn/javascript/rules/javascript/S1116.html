<p>Extra semicolons (<code>;</code>) are usually introduced by mistake, for example because:</p>
<ul>
  <li> It was meant to be replaced by an actual statement, but this was forgotten. </li>
  <li> There was a typo which lead the semicolon to be doubled, i.e. <code>;;</code>. </li>
  <li> There was a misunderstanding about where semicolons are required or useful. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
var x = 1;; // Noncompliant

function foo() {
};  // Noncompliant
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
var x = 1;

function foo() {
}
</pre>
