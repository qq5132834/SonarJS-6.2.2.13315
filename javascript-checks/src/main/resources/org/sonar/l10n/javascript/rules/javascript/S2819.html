<p>HTML5 adds the ability to send messages to documents served from other domains. According to the specification:</p>
<blockquote>
  Authors should not use the wildcard keyword (
  <code>*</code>) in the
  <code>targetOrigin</code> argument in messages that contain any confidential information, as otherwise there is no way to guarantee that the message
  is only delivered to the recipient to which it was intended.
</blockquote>
<p>To mitigate the risk of sending sensitive information to a document served from a hostile or unknown domain, this rule raises an issue each time
<code>Window.postMessage</code> is used.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
var myWindow = document.getElementById('myIFrame').contentWindow;
myWindow.postMessage(message, "*"); // Noncompliant; how do you know what you loaded in 'myIFrame' is still there?
</pre>
